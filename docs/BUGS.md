# BUGS.md — Known parity gaps and surprising behaviors

Captured 2026-05-04 from a behavior-pinning sweep against `stryke v0.11.12` on
macOS aarch64.

Each entry is paired with a test in `tests/suite/behavior_pin_2026_05.rs`
that locks the *current* output. When a bug is fixed, update the corresponding
test rather than deleting it — the test then becomes the regression guard.

Severity legend:

- `parity` — diverges from Perl 5; intentional or accidental TBD
- `bug` — observably wrong vs documented intent
- `polish` — non-critical UX/error-message issue


## PARITY-001 — Magic string increment is not implemented

`++` on a string operand numifies the operand to 0 then increments. Perl 5
performs magic string increment (`"b"++ → "c"`, `"Az"++ → "Ba"`, `"zz"++ → "aaa"`).

```sh
$ stryke -e 'my $x = "b"; $x++; print $x'
1                       # stryke
# perl prints: c

$ stryke -e 'my $x = "Az"; $x++; print $x'
1                       # stryke
# perl prints: Ba

$ stryke --compat -e 'my $x = "b"; $x++; print $x'
1                       # stryke (still numeric even with --compat)
# perl prints: c
```

Tests: `postfix_inc_on_alpha_string_yields_one`,
`postfix_inc_on_alphanumeric_string_yields_one`.

Severity: **parity**. `--compat` is the obvious place for the magic form to
work; today it does not. Fix would live near the postfix-inc lowering on
strings in `interpreter.rs` / `vm.rs`.


## PARITY-002 — `(my $copy = $orig) =~ s///` / `=~ tr///` does not bind to the copy

The classic Perl copy-and-substitute idiom is a no-op in stryke: both `s///`
and `tr///` leave both vars equal to the original.

```sh
$ stryke -e 'my $s = "abc"; (my $t = $s) =~ s/a/X/; print "$s/$t"'
abc/abc                 # stryke
# perl prints: abc/Xbc

$ stryke -e 'my $s = "abc"; (my $t = $s) =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/; print "$s/$t"'
abc/abc                 # stryke
# perl prints: abc/ABC
```

Tests: `copy_on_bind_substitute_does_not_mutate`,
`copy_on_bind_tr_does_not_mutate`, plus the pair of `explicit_copy_then_*`
sanity checks proving the explicit form works.

Severity: **bug**. Affects readability of common idiomatic Perl. Likely
parsing/lvalue-shaping in `parser.rs` for the parenthesized-decl-as-lvalue
case feeding `=~`.


## PARITY-003 — `2 ** 64` falls back to float instead of bigint

```sh
$ stryke -e 'print 2 ** 64'
1.84467440737096e+19    # stryke
# perl prints (with use bigint;): 18446744073709551616
```

Tests: `pow_2_64_uses_float_notation`.

Severity: **parity**. The repo has a `bigint_compat.rs` test suite, so this
is a known limitation rather than oversight. Worth pinning so the float
formatter doesn't change shape silently.


## PARITY-004 — Division by zero surfaces as `ErrorKind::Runtime`, not `DivisionByZero`

`ErrorKind::DivisionByZero` exists as a variant in `error.rs:17`, but the
1/0 path raises a `Runtime` error with message `"Illegal division by zero"`.

Tests: `division_by_zero_is_runtime_error_today`.

Severity: **bug** (low-impact). The variant exists; routing the `/` and `%`
ops to it would let users catch division specifically.


## BUG-001 — `clamp` direct-vs-piped heuristic misroutes single-value pipe

`clamp` uses a runtime heuristic to distinguish `clamp(MIN, MAX, LIST...)`
from a pipe-style call where the LHS is inserted at `args[0]`. The heuristic
checks "if `args[2..]` expands to multiple items, treat the first two as
min/max" (`builtins.rs:6738`). When exactly one value is passed, both call
shapes have identical arity, so the pipe form is decoded as the direct form
and clamps the *min* and *max* against the lone value:

```sh
$ stryke -e 'print clamp(0, 10, 15)'
10                      # direct, correct

$ stryke -e 'print 15 |> clamp(0, 10)'
15                      # piped, wrong — should be 10
```

Tests: not yet pinned (requires deciding which behavior is canonical
before locking it). Suggested fix: distinguish via call site (parser knows
whether it lowered a `|>`) rather than via runtime arity heuristic.

Severity: **bug**. Pipe-friendliness is a feature stryke ships, so a
broken pipe form for a documented builtin is high-visibility.


## POLISH-001 — Builtin-redefinition error tells user to use `fn` when they already did

When a `fn` declaration shadows a stryke builtin, the rejection message
reads:

> `id` is a stryke builtin and cannot be redefined (this is not Perl 5;
> use `fn` not `sub`, or pass --compat)

…but the user typed `fn` already. The message should branch on the
keyword observed:

- if `sub` — keep current text
- if `fn` — drop the "use `fn` not `sub`" half; only suggest `--compat`

Tests: `redefining_builtin_id_is_rejected`,
`redefining_builtin_squared_is_rejected` (these only assert that an error
is raised, not the wording, so they survive a wording fix).

Severity: **polish**.


## POLISH-002 — `++` on a non-lvalue reports `PostfixOp on non-scalar`

```sh
$ stryke -e '("b"++)'
VM compile error (unsupported): PostfixOp on non-scalar at -e line 0.
```

The operand is a scalar; the issue is that it is not assignable. A more
accurate message would be "Can't modify constant string in postfix ++"
(matches Perl 5 phrasing) or "postfix ++ requires an lvalue".

Severity: **polish**.


## PARITY-005 — Modulo follows sign-of-dividend, not sign-of-divisor

Stryke uses Rust/C semantics for `%`:

```sh
$ stryke -e 'print -7 % 3, " / ", 7 % -3'
-1 / 1
$ perl   -e 'print -7 % 3, " / ", 7 % -3'
2 / -2
```

Tests: `mod_negative_dividend_positive_divisor_returns_negative`,
`mod_positive_dividend_negative_divisor_returns_positive`.

Severity: **parity**. Worth deciding whether this is intentional (faster /
matches Rust ergonomics) or a parity bug.


## PARITY-006 — `sprintf "%g"` falls back to `%f` formatting

```sh
$ stryke -e 'printf "%g\n", 0.0001; printf "%g\n", 1234567'
0.000100
1234567.000000
$ perl   -e 'printf "%g\n", 0.0001; printf "%g\n", 1234567'
0.0001
1.23457e+06
```

Tests: `sprintf_g_format_uses_fixed_decimal_today`.

Severity: **parity**. `%g`'s job is shortest-of-`%e`-or-`%f`; stryke just
uses `%f`.


## PARITY-007 — `sprintf "%e"` omits the `+` sign and zero-pad on the exponent

```sh
$ stryke -e 'printf "%e\n", 12345.6789'
1.234568e4
$ perl   -e 'printf "%e\n", 12345.6789'
1.234568e+04
```

Tests: `sprintf_e_format_omits_plus_and_zero_pad_today`.

Severity: **parity**.


## PARITY-008 — `sprintf "%v..."` not implemented

`%v` is supposed to interpret the argument as a version string (one byte
per dot-separated component). Stryke emits the raw value followed by the
literal letter that was supposed to be the format suffix:

```sh
$ stryke -e 'print sprintf("%vd", "1.2.3")'
1.2.3d
$ perl   -e 'print sprintf("%vd", "1.2.3")'
49.46.50.46.51
```

Tests: `sprintf_v_format_emits_literal_today`.

Severity: **parity** (rarely used).


## PARITY-009 — `sprintf` positional `%N$s` not implemented

```sh
$ stryke -e 'print sprintf("%2\$s %1\$s", "world", "hello")'
worlds hellos
$ perl   -e 'print sprintf("%2\$s %1\$s", "world", "hello")'
hello world
```

Tests: `sprintf_positional_arg_emits_literal_today`.

Severity: **parity** (i18n-relevant).


## PARITY-010 — `vec($s, $offset, $bits) = N` rejected as complex lvalue

```sh
$ stryke -e 'my $s = ""; vec($s, 0, 8) = 65; print $s'
VM compile error (unsupported): Assign to complex lvalue at -e line 0.
```

Severity: **parity**. `vec` lvalue assignment is the standard way to do
bit-packing in Perl 5.


## PARITY-011 — `CORE::*` namespace not available

```sh
$ stryke -e 'CORE::print "hi"'
Undefined subroutine &CORE::print at -e line 1.
```

Severity: **parity**. Affects code that explicitly disambiguates between
overridden and built-in operations.


## PARITY-012 — `use overload "+" => sub { ... }` rejects anonymous-sub handlers

```sh
$ stryke -e 'package N; use overload "+" => sub { 1 }'
overload handler must be a string literal, number (e.g. fallback => 1),
or \&subname (method in current package) at -e line 1.
```

Workaround: declare a named sub and pass `\&name`. Perl 5 accepts
anonymous subs directly.

Severity: **parity**.


## BUG-002 — Blessed arrayrefs stringify with `HASH` tag

```sh
$ stryke -e 'my $o = bless [1,2,3], "Bar"; print "$o\n"; print ref($o)'
Bar=HASH(0x...)
Bar
$ perl   -e 'my $o = bless [1,2,3], "Bar"; print "$o\n"; print ref($o)'
Bar=ARRAY(0x559abc...)
Bar
```

`ref()` correctly returns `Bar`; only the stringification is wrong (always
`HASH`). The `0x...` literal placeholder is intentional (stryke does not
expose live addresses).

Tests: `bless_arrayref_stringifies_with_hash_tag_today`.

Severity: **bug**.


## BUG-003 — `$self->SUPER::method` overflows the stack inside `class extends`

```sh
$ stryke -e '
class Animal { fn speak { "generic" } }
class Dog extends Animal { fn speak { "woof+" . $self->SUPER::speak } }
say Dog()->speak;'
thread 'main' has overflowed its stack
fatal runtime error: stack overflow, aborting
```

The Perl-5-style `our @ISA = (...)` + `$self->SUPER::speak` form works
correctly (see `perl5_super_call_through_isa_works`). The bug is specific
to the native-class MRO path.

Tests: `class_extends_overrides_parent_method` (works without SUPER),
`perl5_super_call_through_isa_works` (the path that does work).

Severity: **bug**. Almost any non-trivial class hierarchy will need
`SUPER::`; without it, `extends` is half-broken.


## BUG-004 — Pipe `|>` with arrayref LHS does not auto-dereference

```sh
$ stryke -e 'my @a = (1..5); print @a |> sum'
15                                  # @-array LHS works
$ stryke -e 'print [1..5] |> sum'
0                                   # arrayref LHS broken
$ stryke -e 'my @r = [1..5] |> map { _ * 2 }; print scalar @r, ":", $r[0]'
1:0                                 # one iteration with _ = the arrayref
```

Either of two fixes is reasonable: auto-deref arrayref LHS into a list, or
reject arrayref LHS at parse time so the user is forced to write `@$ref |>`.

Tests: `pipe_with_arrayref_into_sum_returns_zero_today`,
`pipe_with_arrayref_through_map_returns_single_zero_today`,
`pipe_with_array_var_through_map_and_sum` (the form that works).

Severity: **bug**. Arrayrefs are the natural unit of data flow in stryke
(every pipe-friendly builtin returns one), so a broken pipe entry-point
for arrayrefs is high-visibility.


## BUG-005 — `(caller(N))[3]` (subroutine name) is undef

```sh
$ stryke -e '
sub g { my @c = caller(0); join("|", map { defined $_ ? $_ : "(undef)" } @c[0..3]) }
sub fnx { g() }
say fnx();'
main|-e|2|(undef)
```

Index 3 of the `caller()` list should be the fully-qualified subroutine
name (`main::g`). Stryke currently leaves it undef.

Tests: `caller_zero_omits_subroutine_name_today`.

Severity: **bug**. Breaks any logger / decorator that prints the calling
sub's name.


## BUG-006 — `chomp @array` does not behave as documented

```sh
$ stryke -e 'my @s = ("a\n", "b\n"); chomp @s; print join("|", @s)'
2
$ perl   -e 'my @s = ("a\n", "b\n"); chomp @s; print join("|", @s)'
a|b
```

The number `2` is the count of items in `@s` (or the chomp count, which
would be `2` regardless). Whether the array is mutated is unclear from this
output alone — needs a focused investigation. Pinning is deferred until the
behavior is understood.

Severity: **bug** (pending root-cause analysis).


## BUG-007 — `Util->greet(...)` of a `Self.greet($name)` static method passes class as first arg

```sh
$ stryke -e '
class Util { fn Self.greet($name) { "hi, $name" } }
say Util->greet("world");'
hi, Util
```

`Util->greet("world")` should either be rejected (this is a static method,
call it as `Util.greet("world")`) or strip the class name from the front
of `@_` before binding. Today the user gets a silent argument shift.

Tests: `arrow_invoke_of_static_method_passes_class_as_first_arg_today`.

Severity: **bug**.


## BUG-008 — `%h{KEYS}` kv-slice returns the full hash

```sh
$ stryke -e 'my %h = (a=>1, b=>2, c=>3); my %sub = %h{qw(a c)}; say sort keys %sub'
a b c                       # stryke (wrong)
$ perl   -e 'my %h = (a=>1, b=>2, c=>3); my %sub = %h{qw(a c)}; say sort keys %sub'
a c                         # perl
```

Tests: `kv_slice_returns_full_hash_today`.

Severity: **bug**. Was added to Perl in 5.20; widely used.


## BUG-009 — `exists $h{x}{y}` errors when `$h{x}` is missing

```sh
$ stryke -e 'my %h = (a => {b => 1}); say exists $h{x}{y} ? 1 : 0'
exists argument is not a HASH reference at -e line 1.
$ perl   -e 'my %h = (a => {b => 1}); say exists $h{x}{y} ? 1 : 0'
0
```

The intermediate hash should be auto-vivified to an empty hashref for the
purpose of `exists`, then the inner check returns false. Stryke fails the
deref step instead.

Tests: `exists_on_missing_intermediate_errors_today`,
`exists_on_present_chain_returns_true`.

Severity: **bug**.


## POLISH-003 — `say BAREWORD()->method()` parses BAREWORD as a filehandle

```sh
$ stryke -e 'class C { fn m2($x) { $x * 2 } } say C()->m2(5)'
print on unopened filehandle C at -e line 1.
$ stryke -e 'class C { fn m2($x) { $x * 2 } } say(C()->m2(5))'
10
```

Workaround: parenthesize the argument to `say`. The error message at
least names the offending bareword, which helps; a smarter
"is-this-a-class?" check could give a friendlier hint.

Severity: **polish**.


## POLISH-004 — Class method named `m` is parsed as the regex-match operator

```sh
$ stryke -e 'class C { fn m($x, $y) { $x + $y } }'
Expected method name, got Regex("$x, $y", "", '(') at -e line 1.
```

The lexer sees `m(` after `fn` and commits to the regex-match form. A
post-`fn` lookahead would resolve this. Workaround: name the method
something other than `m` (or `s`, `tr`, `y`, `qr`, `q`, `qq`, `qw`).

Severity: **polish**.


## NOT-A-BUG observations (pinned, but documented as deliberate)

These are known design choices, listed here so a future contributor doesn't
"fix" them:

- **`succ`/`pred` are numeric-only.** `succ("b")` returns `1`, not `"c"`.
  See test `succ_on_string_numifies_to_zero_plus_one`. The Perl-magic form
  is reachable only through `++`, which is governed by PARITY-001 above.

- **Many short names are stryke builtins** (`fact`, `factorial`, `id`,
  `squared`, `cubed`, `f`, etc.). Outside `--compat`, `fn name { ... }`
  for any of these is a parse-time rejection. Tests cover `id` and
  `squared`. Note that `neg` is *not* a builtin — calling `neg(7)` raises
  `Undefined subroutine &neg`, so the unary-minus role still belongs to
  the `-` operator.

- **`p` of an arrayref/hashref prints `ARRAY(0x...)` / `HASH(0x...)`.**
  This matches Perl's `print` semantics for refs. To dump structure, use
  the appropriate dump helper.


## How to add to this file

When you find a new behavior worth tracking:

1. Add a numbered section (continue PARITY-NNN / BUG-NNN / POLISH-NNN).
2. Show the minimal reproducer with `stryke -e '...'` and the observed
   output. If applicable, contrast with `perl -e '...'`.
3. Add a pinning test in `tests/suite/behavior_pin_2026_05.rs` (or a
   dated successor, e.g. `behavior_pin_2026_06.rs` once this file fills).
4. Cite the test name(s) in the BUGS.md entry so they stay linked.

Do not delete entries when a bug is fixed — flip the test from "current
buggy output" to "correct output" and mark the entry **FIXED** with the
commit hash and date.
