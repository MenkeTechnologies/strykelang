//! Which fusevm execution tier a program's bytecode actually reaches.
//!
//! Enabling the JIT is not the same as being compiled by it, and the only
//! honest way to tell the two apart is to ask the VM. This module runs a
//! program and then queries fusevm's own eligibility and cache predicates —
//! `is_block_eligible`, `block_jit_is_compiled`, `trace_is_compiled`,
//! `find_jit_region` — so the answer comes from the compiler that would have
//! done the work rather than from an assumption about it.
//!
//! `stryke --tiers script.sk` prints the report.
//!
//! One stryke-specific caveat the report cannot state for itself: stryke's
//! fusevm-native path (`fusevm_native::lower_to_fusevm`) covers a subset of the
//! language, and everything outside it lowers to `Op::Extended` — a dispatch
//! back into stryke's own runtime. So a `block-ineligible ops` list dominated
//! by `Extended` is not saying "the tiers refused this work"; it is saying the
//! work never reached fusevm in the first place. Shrinking that count means
//! widening the lowering, not changing the script.
